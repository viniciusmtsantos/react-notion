  `<h2>What is Tailwind CSS?</h2>
  <p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a collection of low-level utility classes. These classes can be directly applied to your HTML elements to achieve various styles. Unlike traditional frameworks that offer pre-built components, Tailwind gives you complete control over the styling of your website.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Tailwind CSS is a fantastic option for developers who want to build modern websites quickly and efficiently. It removes the need for writing a lot of custom CSS, making development faster and more enjoyable."</p>
    <p> - John Doe, Front-End Developer</p>

  <pre> <code class="language-javascript">console.log('Hello World!')</code> </pre>

  <p>The above code snippet demonstrates how to use Tailwind classes to style a simple section. The container class
    provides basic padding and margin, while mx - auto centers the content horizontally. The h1 and p elements leverage
    utility classes for text size, color, and spacing. Finally, the button utilizes multiple classes to define its
    background color, hover effect, text color, and styling.
