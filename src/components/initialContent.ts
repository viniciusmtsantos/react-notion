  <h2>What is Tailwind CSS?</h2>
  <p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a collection of low-level utility classes. These classes can be directly applied to your HTML elements to achieve various styles. Unlike traditional frameworks that offer pre-built components, Tailwind gives you complete control over the styling of your website.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Tailwind CSS is a fantastic option for developers who want to build modern websites quickly and efficiently. It removes the need for writing a lot of custom CSS, making development faster and more enjoyable."</p>
    <p> - John Doe, Front-End Developer</p>

  </ul>

  <code>
    &lt;div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-8 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg"&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4"&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class="text-gray-700 mb-8"&gt;This is some content with a gray color class.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded shadow"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  </code>

  <p>The above code snippet demonstrates how to use Tailwind classes to style a simple section. The container class
    provides basic padding and margin, while mx - auto centers the content horizontally. The h1 and p elements leverage
    utility classes for text size, color, and spacing. Finally, the button utilizes multiple classes to define its
    background color, hover effect, text color, and styling.
